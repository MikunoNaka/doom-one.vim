> Come join the dark side

This colorscheme is a slightly modified version of [romgrk/doom-one.vim](https://github.com/romgrk/doom-one.vim) and is ported from [doom-one](https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/blob/master/themes/doom-one-theme.el) because I like ~~sane~~ defaults hehe

## Install

```vim
Plug 'MikunoNaka/doom-one.vim'
```

## Options

Neovim terminal coloring can be enabled as by adding the following above the plugin includes:
```vim
let g:doom_one_terminal_colors = v:true
